    "Purpose: Linear regression is used for predicting continuous numerical outcomes, such as predicting house prices based on square footage. Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of two classes, like whether an email is spam or not.\n",
    "Output: Linear regression produces a continuous output, whereas logistic regression produces a probability value between 0 and 1, which is then thresholded to make binary predictions.\n",
    "Model Function: Linear regression uses a linear equation to model the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable. Logistic regression uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to model the probability of belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "Example: Logistic regression is more appropriate when you need to predict outcomes with two classes, such as whether a customer will buy a product (yes/no) based on their purchase history."
